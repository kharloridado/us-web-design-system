/* validate-theme.mjs — make the deterministic gate actually deterministic.
 *
 * The @checker treats `npm run build:theme` exiting 0 as a HARD WALL: proof that the
 * tree builds before any subjective review happens. That claim was false. build-theme.mjs
 * is a text assembler — it concatenates and re-sections CSS, it never parses it. An
 * unbalanced brace in a token file produced a corrupt dist/theme.css and still exited 0,
 * so a broken theme could sail through the gate and get reviewed as if it were fine.
 *
 * This closes that hole. Two checks, both mechanical, both un-reasoned-past:
 *
 *   1. SYNTAX — parse the assembled theme with lightningcss. A parse error is a build
 *      failure, full stop.
 *   2. SCHEMA — every var(--token) reference resolves to a definition (or carries an
 *      explicit fallback). A dangling var() is silently invalid at runtime: the property
 *      just doesn't apply, and the component renders subtly wrong with no error anywhere.
 *
 * Usage:  node build/validate-theme.mjs      (runs as part of npm run build:theme) */

 * treats a custom property's value as an opaque token stream, so `--x: ` left dangling by
 * an unbalanced brace parses "fine" — the corruption only shows up as silently missing
 * rules at runtime. Since build-theme.mjs is a text assembler that concatenates files, an
 * unterminated comment or a stray brace in ONE token file is the single most likely way to
 * corrupt the whole theme. That is precisely the failure the deterministic gate exists to
