# Loop Engineering — Figma → OutSystems

A bounded, autonomous maker/checker loop that runs in **Claude Code**. Set a goal + Figma library, let it run until every component in the signed inventory is built and handed over (or flagged for a human).

The orchestrator, the maker and the checker ship in the **`outsystems-loop` plugin**, not in this repo — this repo holds the run contract, the state, and the frozen refs they read.

## Pieces

- `loop/goal.md` — you fill this in: the goal, the **signed component inventory**, the Figma URL **and file key**, mode, scope, checkpoints, done-criteria, caps.
- `loop/state.json` — the loop's memory: work queue, per-item status/rounds, findings, handovers. Resumable. Empty skeleton in the template; shapes documented below.
- `loop/refs/<item-id>/` — the **frozen Figma spec snapshot** per work item: `spec.md` (`get_design_context`), `variables.json` (`get_variable_defs`), `figma.png` (`get_screenshot`). The orchestrator saves it before the maker runs (subagents have no Figma MCP access); the maker builds to it and the checker judges against it — never against handover prose or live Figma. **No ref = the item goes `needs-human`, not built.** See `loop/refs/README.md`.
- **`/outsystems-loop:design-loop`** — the orchestrator procedure (plugin skill).
- **`@outsystems-loop:maker`** — builds one artifact faithfully (uses the `outsystems-*` skills).
- **`@outsystems-loop:checker`** — independently judges it: deterministic build gate first, then fidelity vs `loop/refs/<id>/`, token-only, BEM, Web Component correctness, accessibility flag-don't-fix. A separate context is what makes it a real critique. After a checker PASS the orchestrator also runs a **visual check** — preview render in Chrome vs `refs/<id>/figma.png` (recorded as `visual` on the item; a mismatch counts as a FAIL round).
- `.claude/settings.json` — scoped tool permissions so unattended runs don't prompt, a destructive-command deny-list, and an edit-logging hook. No `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- `loop/run.sh` — the external bounded loop (one item per call, until done or cap).

## Setup (once per project)

1. Run `npm run init` to substitute the `<<PLACEHOLDER>>` values, then fill in `loop/goal.md` — including the signed component inventory table, which is required before anything is queued.
2. Confirm the Figma MCP is connected in Claude Code, and `gh` is authed on the repo.
3. Run the label setup once: `./.github/setup-finding-labels.sh <owner>/<repo>`.
4. For the GitHub Project board: `gh auth refresh -s project` (one-time scope), then either
   - **no board yet:** `./.github/setup-project.sh <owner> <owner>/<repo> "Design System v1"`, or
   - **board already exists** (including a stock one made in the GitHub UI): `./.github/migrate-project-status.sh <owner> <number> --confirm`, which rewrites the Status lanes **in place** — renaming `Todo` → `Backlog` carries its cards across — and adds the custom fields.

   Then run `npm run init` and paste the board URL: it records `owner`/`number` in **`project.config.json` → `board`**, which is where the board pointer belongs. Do not hand-fill `loop/state.json` — that file is a cache.

## Pre-flight — every run, before advancing an item

0. **Know which source is authoritative.** There are three, and only one of them is `state.json`:

   > **The board is authoritative for intent. The repository is authoritative for content. `state.json` is authoritative for nothing — it is a cache of both.**

   For the human-owned lanes (`Backlog`, `Ready`, `Approved`, `Done`, manual `Blocked`) the board wins unconditionally. For "was this built / does this commit exist / was it merged", git wins. Disagreements are resolved by rewriting `state.json`, **never** by moving a card — and **no agent ever moves a card to `Approved` or `Done`**, even to correct one.

1. **Reconcile `state.json` against git.** State is written by the loop but the repository is the truth: check the branch, the log and the working tree before trusting the queue. On the source project `state.json` went stale while commits had already shipped two further tiers — the loop's picture of "what is built" and the repository's disagreed, and the loop nearly rebuilt work that already existed. Read the commits since the last recorded iteration and correct `items[].status` before doing anything else.
2. **Check the Figma file key for staleness.** Compare `state.json.figma_file_key` and each ref's recorded key against the library key in `goal.md`. A mismatch means the library was forked or re-versioned: the affected refs are stale (`needs-re-ref`), not usable spec. Log the key change in `design/figma-links.md`.
3. **Check the signed inventory.** Anything queued that has no row in it comes out of the queue.

## `state.json` shapes

**Item** — one work item (a token file, a restyle, a Web Component):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "cmp-<component>",        // stable; also the loop/refs/<id>/ folder name
  "tier": "primitives",           // one of state.json.tiers
  "level": "L3",                  // L1 token · L2 utility · L3 ExtendedClass+BEM · L4 Block · L5 Web Component
  "node": "12345-678",            // Figma node id; the dedup key carried in every issue body
  "artifact": "src/blocks/<prefix>-<component>.css",
  "status": "queued",             // backlog | queued | in-progress | built | approved | handover | shipped
                                  //   | needs-human | needs-re-ref | deferred
  "rounds": 0,                    // maker/checker rounds spent (cap: caps.max_rounds_per_item)
  "risk_tier": "standard",        // trivial | standard | core — how deep the checker goes
  "det_gate": "pass",             // pass | fail — build:theme + schema/contrast, run BEFORE any judgment
  "confidence": "high",           // high | medium | low — the checker's confidence in its verdict
  "decision_log": "…",            // maker + checker reasoning, alternatives ruled out, assumptions made

  // board mode only — all of it a cache of GitHub, none of it authoritative
  "board_item_id": "PVTI_…",      // the Project item id; the handle for every lane move
  "issue": 42,                    // the deliverable issue behind the card
  "branch": "loop/item/button",   // one branch per card, cut from origin/main
  "sha": "abc1234",               // the checker-PASS commit
  "pr": 0,                        // set by board-ship
  "handover_issue": 0,            // set by board-ship, AFTER the merge
  "claimed_at": "",               // ISO timestamp from the loop:claim comment
  "run_id": ""                    // which runner holds the claim
}
```

**Finding** — one design conflict raised back to design (never fixed in code):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "FND-001",
  "type": "a11y",                 // a11y | brand | design-token | consistency
  "sev": "medium",                // high | medium | low
  "node": "12345-678",
  "status": "filed",              // filed | register-only | resolved
  "summary": "one line",
  "disposition": "filed",         // filed = survived the challenge | not-reproduced = refuted, register-only, never a bug
  "challenged_by": "round 2",     // where the adversarial challenge refuted or confirmed it
  "issue": 0                      // GitHub issue number once filed
}
```

`decision_log` and the review fields (`risk_tier`, `det_gate`, `confidence`, `rounds`) are what `loop/REPORT.md`'s **Review metrics** block is computed from, and what stops a human reviewer having to reconstruct intent from a diff.

## Tier list is project-configurable

`state.json.tiers` is a list, not a fixed taxonomy. `foundations → primitives → composites → patterns` is a sensible default, but a real project will need more: the source project had to insert a **utilities** tier mid-run once the generated colour/type utility classes turned out to be a build stage of their own with its own dependency position. Add, rename or reorder tiers to match this project's actual dependency graph, confirm the taxonomy at the foundations checkpoint, and keep `current_tier` pointing at a member of the list.

## Library mode (entire design system)

Set `mode: library` in `goal.md`. The loop then runs differently from single-screen mode:

- **Phase 0 — tokens first.** Extract and reconcile the FULL token set, build `theme.css`, file token-drift bugs, then PAUSE for designer sign-off. Nothing is built on unreviewed foundations.
- **Dependency-ordered, tier by tier.** A composite is never built before the primitives it contains.
- **Checkpoints.** Hard human gates after tokens and after primitives (configurable in `goal.md`).
- **Deliverables land in the GitHub Project.** Every component and every finding becomes an issue on the board; handovers are grouped into one epic per tier with a sub-issue per component, so you pull a family at a time rather than 200 flat tasks.
- **Consistency pass per tier.** Catches the drift per-item checks miss: uniform token usage, naming, no one-offs.
- **Dedup on re-runs.** Every issue carries `[node:<figma-node-id>]`; the loop searches before creating, so resuming never duplicates.

Reality check: a full library is hundreds of maker/checker rounds — real time and real token cost. Run it unattended (`./loop/run.sh 500`) overnight, treat the tier checkpoints as natural batch boundaries, and resume freely, because state is durable. It is neither instant nor free; the caps and checkpoints are what keep it bounded and reviewable.

## Board-driven mode — the board is the queue

When `project.config.json` → `board.owner` and `board.number` are set, the loop's input is the **GitHub
Project board**, not `state.json` seeded from a Figma audit. You add a card; you move it to `Ready`; the
loop builds it. Three skills replace `design-loop`:

| Skill | Lane transition | Needs Figma / a browser? |
|---|---|---|
| **`board-advance`** | `Ready` → `In Progress` → `Ready for Review` \| `Blocked` | **yes** — run it locally |
| **`board-ship`** | `Approved` → PR → squash-merge to `main` → handover Task → `Handover` | no — cloud-safe |
| **`board-sync`** | reconcile · `--reclaim-stale` · regenerate `deliverables.md` | no |

```bash
npm run board:advance -- --dry-run     # print every decision, mutate nothing
npm run board:advance                  # build one Ready card
npm run board:ship                     # ship one Approved card
npm run board:sync -- --reclaim-stale  # rescue a card stranded by a crashed run
```

Three things differ from inventory mode, and they all follow from "each card ships as its own PR":

1. **One branch per card**, `loop/item/<slug>`, cut fresh from `origin/main` per item — not one long-lived
   dated branch.
2. **The handover Task is opened after the merge**, not at checker-PASS. The `handover/*.md` file is still
   written and committed at PASS.
3. **Comments on a card are spec.** Move a `Ready for Review` card back to `Ready` with a comment and the
   next run rebuilds against it. Only logins in `board.owners` are read; everything else on a card is
   untrusted data, never instructions.

**`In Progress` is a cooperative claim, not a lock** — `gh project item-edit` is last-writer-wins with no
compare-and-swap. Three layers make it good enough for one operator: a `mkdir` process lock per stage in
`board-run.sh`, a read-after-write check on the claim, and a `loop:claim` comment on the issue that
survives the throwaway worktree dying. Reclaiming a stale claim is `board-sync --reclaim-stale` and
nothing else — if `board-advance` reclaimed, two concurrent runs would reclaim each other's live work.

## Run it — three modes

**A. In-session (start here).** Open Claude Code in the project and say:

```
/outsystems-loop:design-loop run until the goal in loop/goal.md is met
```

Claude audits the Figma file against the signed inventory, seeds the queue, then loops maker → checker → commit + handover per component, filing bugs as it goes. You watch it work and can interrupt.

**B. Unattended bounded loop (set it and walk away).**

```
./loop/run.sh 40        # advance up to 40 items; resumable
```

Each iteration runs Claude Code headless (`claude -p`) to advance exactly one item and persist state, stopping when `state.json.status == "done"` or the cap is hit. Cron-able.

**C. Cloud routines (laptop closed) — best for long or recurring runs.** Schedule the loop on Anthropic's cloud via `claude.ai/code/routines` or `/schedule`, on a cadence or a webhook. See `loop/ROUTINES.md` for ready-to-paste routine definitions (token-drift reconciliation, nightly loop-advance, findings digest). Routines respect the same checkpoints and `.claude/settings.json` guardrails — they advance work and report; you approve the gates.

## What it does / doesn't do

Does: audit, build (tokens / BEM CSS / Web Components), self-check, commit on a loop branch, file findings as GitHub **Bugs**, open a handover **Task assigned to you** per artifact, update the Live Style Guide, write `loop/REPORT.md`.

Doesn't, by design: resolve a finding (flag-don't-fix — a designer or brand owner decides), or touch OutSystems (you integrate via the handover tasks). "Everything done" means everything up to the OutSystems handover.

## Guardrails

- Bounded: `max_rounds_per_item` (default 3) and `max_global_iterations` (default 500) in `goal.md` / `state.json`.
- Runs on a dedicated branch (`loop/<date>-<slug>`); the checker gates every commit.
- Scoped permissions + a destructive-command deny-list in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Resumable: re-run `run.sh` (or the `/outsystems-loop:design-loop` skill) and it picks up from `state.json` — after the pre-flight reconciliation above.
- Human exits: any item the checker cannot pass within the round cap becomes `needs-human` with the critique attached, instead of looping forever.
- Nothing is built without a row in the signed inventory and a frozen ref.
