# UI Quality Assessment — Rules and Guidelines

> Canonical rubric for the [`runtime-ui-audit`](SKILL.md) skill. Last rubric version: 12 May 2026. When a criterion's intent or tier boundary seems ambiguous, this file wins.

## What are we measuring?

A framework for scoring the **UI quality** of external-facing apps from captured images. It covers **16 criteria** across 6 categories and produces a single weighted score per assessment. Current scope is **external-facing apps only** — internal tools and designs are out of scope.

This judges *what the user sees and experiences* (perceived quality), not how the app was built. The build-focused counterpart is [`review-ui-implementation`](../review-ui-implementation/rubric.md).

## Scoring system

Each criterion receives exactly one of: **Market Leading**, **Delightful**, **Acceptable**, **Unpleasant**, **Broken**, or **N/A**.

```
Numerator    = Σ score_value(i) × weight(i)
Denominator  = Σ max_score(i) × weight(i)   [non-N/A items only]
Final %      = Numerator ÷ Denominator × 100
```

**Score values:** Market Leading = 4 · Delightful = 3 · Acceptable = 2 · Unpleasant = 1 · Broken = 0
**Weights:** C1–C13 → 1× · C14, C15, C16 (User Perception) → 1.5×

**Examples:** all 16 Acceptable (2) → 35 ÷ 70 × 100 = **50%** · all 16 Market Leading (4) → **100%**.

**Low-confidence flag:** if **6 or more** criteria are N/A, flag the score as low-confidence (rubric is <63% complete).

**Overall tiers:**

| Range | Tier |
|---|---|
| ≥ 85% | Market Leading |
| 65–84% | Delightful |
| 45–64% | Acceptable |
| 25–44% | Unpleasant |
| < 25% | Broken |

**N/A** means the criterion cannot be evaluated from the provided images. **Prefer N/A over guessing.**

**Default N/A rules** — apply unless evidence explicitly overrides:

- **Keyboard interaction (C6)** → N/A unless a focused-element state is captured (a focus ring visible in a screenshot, or a focus probe).
- **Animations (C11)** → N/A unless motion is captured (recording, filmstrip) or motion signals are probed (computed `transition`/`animation`).
- **Micro-interactions (C12)** → N/A unless hover/active/success states are captured or probed.
- **State Communication (C10)** → N/A only when zero loading, error, empty, and task-completion states are visible across all captures. If any one is present, it must be scored.
- **IA & App Depth (C9)** → N/A only if a single isolated widget with no navigation context is captured.

## Design system

### C1 — Theme & Styling

**Measure:** Design tokens (color, type, spacing, radius, elevation, iconography, imagery) are consistent AND reflect current best practice. Consistent-but-dated is not Delightful.

Look for: one brand color + neutrals + max 2–3 semantic colors (warm colors only for error/warning/destructive, never decorative); 1–2 type families, ≤3 size/weight steps, body line-height ≥ 1.5; one consistent radius (no mixing 0/4/8/16px); soft shadows (hard drop shadows read dated); icon style scoped by zone (nav one family, content/illustration may differ — only penalise two competing families in the *same* zone); one imagery treatment; disabled elements visually distinct. **FAIL SIGNAL:** OutSystems UI default theme / Bootstrap tells — gray top bar, stock blue (`#1068eb`), pill buttons with heavy shadow, `#f3f6f8` body background.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Every token intentional and ownable; visual language unmistakably this product, recognisable without the logo; color science, type ramp, icon system, spatial rhythm cohere as one confident hand. |
| Delightful | Coherent, current token set throughout — modern palette, clean type ramp, soft shadows, one icon family, unified imagery, warm colors for status only. |
| Acceptable | Recognisable theme but drift in 2–3 places (mixed radius, one off-palette color, one mixed icon) OR consistent but dated in one dimension. |
| Unpleasant | Multiple token inconsistencies across categories: mixed radius AND competing accents AND mixed icon sets in the same zones. |
| Broken | Multiple unrelated visual languages on one screen, OR 5+ unrelated accent colors, OR clearly mixed icon sets. |

N/A only if no product-owned UI styling is visible. False positives: user-submitted content (avatars, thumbnails) and chart-library colors are exempt.

### C2 — Component Reuse

**Measure:** Components are reused from a shared library AND well-built (proper variants, states, affordances). Reusing a dated/broken component is not Delightful.

Look for: all primary buttons identical across screens (same for secondary/destructive/ghost); buttons have hover/focus/disabled/loading states; inputs consistently styled with validation/error states; checkboxes for multi-select, radios for single-select (misuse = failure); labels persistent above inputs (never placeholder-only); one version each of cards/tabs/modals/tooltips/breadcrumbs/badges. **RED FLAG:** two visually different "primary" buttons on one screen. Components should feel like current libraries (shadcn, Radix, Material 3), not jQuery UI 2012.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Zero competing styles; every instance identical in proportion, color, spacing across the product; well-built with proper states/variants/affordances. |
| Delightful | Single visual language, no competing styles for the same element type; proper states/variants; labels persistent. |
| Acceptable | Visual language present with isolated drift: one or two element types inconsistent, OR coherent library but missing states/variants. |
| Unpleasant | Noticeable inconsistency across multiple component types, or systematic missing states. |
| Broken | Competing visual styles for the same element type, OR components consistently badly built with no states/affordances. |

N/A only if no interactive components visible.

### C3 — Component Fit & Purposeful Config

**Measure:** Components are not only correct for the content type but **purposefully configured** for the use case — real data, domain-appropriate interaction modes, intentional state handling.

Purposeful: Kanban with live counts/WIP limits; step wizard for multi-stage flows; filter tabs with live counts ("Active (12) · Pending (5)"); charts with domain-specific axes/labels; tables with curated (not every-field) columns. Not purposeful: card grid for back-office data management (wrong type); generic KPI cards with no domain specificity; default flat table/chart.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Every major surface uses a component purposefully configured for its job; data structures inform the choice (trading terminal, maintenance timeline, pipeline Kanban with live counts); custom configs that wouldn't exist in a generic template. |
| Delightful | Primary surfaces purposefully configured (step wizards, filter tabs with counts, configured charts); some secondary surfaces more generic. |
| Acceptable | Right component, default configuration only — table for tabular data but all columns uncurated; chart present but placeholder-feeling labels. |
| Unpleasant | One or more wrong component choices for the domain, or correct type but broken/misleading config. |
| Broken | Components work against the use case; integration failures exposed (broken tokens, raw IDs where names belong, empty viz with no fallback). |

N/A if not enough UI patterns visible. False positives: card grid for browsing (marketplace, gallery, file picker) is correct; accordions for genuinely secondary content are fine.

---

## Accessibility

### C4 — Color Contrast (WCAG AA)

**Measure:** Text/interactive elements clear WCAG AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text & UI components); color is never the sole differentiator for status/errors.

Look for: near-black on near-white passes; RISKY — light gray text (`#9CA3AF`, `#CCCCCC`) on white, white on light brand colors, colored links on matching-value backgrounds; secondary/tertiary text (captions, placeholders, timestamps, muted tags) are the most common failures; icon-only buttons with low-contrast glyphs; disabled still visible; errors paired with icon/text (red border alone insufficient — ~8% of males have red-green deficiency); links distinguished by more than color (underline/weight); charts use patterns/labels alongside color.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | All text & interactive elements pass AA; no color as sole differentiator anywhere; charts accessible with patterns/labels. |
| Delightful | Primary and secondary text clearly pass AA; color never sole differentiator; charts accessible. Flag "eye-test pass; automated audit recommended". |
| Acceptable | Primary text passes; 1–2 tertiary/muted elements risky; color sole differentiator in isolated cases. |
| Unpleasant | Multiple contrast failures across secondary text/placeholders/icon buttons; color sole differentiator in several key states. |
| Broken | Obvious low-contrast body text, near-invisible placeholders, white-on-light CTAs, or color as only means to distinguish errors/status. |

N/A if image quality too low or no text/interactive elements visible. False positives: ghost buttons on hero images fine if the image provides contrast.

### C5 — Tap / Click Target Size

**Measure:** % of interactive targets ≥ 44×44px. Market Leading = 100% · Delightful ≥ 95% · Acceptable 80–94% · Unpleasant 60–79% · Broken < 60%.

Look for: primary CTAs/nav/filters/card click areas usually fine; RISKY — icon-only toolbar buttons, kebab/row actions in dense tables, small inline links, chip close buttons, star ratings, narrow tab triggers, pagination; ≥ 8px gap between adjacent targets; checkbox/radio hit zones extend to the label. Mobile minimum is 44px; desktop secondary actions can go lower but primary actions still ≥ 32px. Calibration: use body text (~14–16px) as a scale reference — a target ~3× body-text height ≈ 44px. **A tap-target probe (measured bounding boxes) is authoritative when available.**

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | 100% ≥ 44px; exceptionally generous padding on icon buttons; all labels extend hit zones. |
| Delightful | ≥ 95% ≥ 44px; generous icon-button padding; labels extend hit zones; ≥ 8px spacing. |
| Acceptable | 80–94%; some dense table actions or toolbar icons < 44px but labels carry the hit zone. |
| Unpleasant | 60–79%; multiple controls clearly under 44px in primary/frequent areas. |
| Broken | < 60%; obvious cramping — 12px toolbar icons, 8px close buttons, tightly-stacked inline links with no padding. |

N/A if resolution makes sizing unreliable.

### C6 — Keyboard Interaction

**Measure:** All interactive elements reachable/operable by keyboard, with visible focus state and logical tab order.

Look for: visible focus ring on any captured focused element (outline/ring/background change); focus ring **designed**, not just the default browser ring; tab order follows reading order; modals trap focus, Escape closes; dropdowns support arrow keys; custom components match native keyboard patterns; skip-to-content link near the top.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | All focus rings custom-designed and distinctive; tab order perfect; all custom components have correct keyboard patterns; skip-to-content present. |
| Delightful | Focus rings visible and consistently designed; tab order follows layout; modals trap focus; Escape works; custom components correct. |
| Acceptable | Some focus styles visible but inconsistent; tab order mostly logical. |
| Unpleasant | Focus rings absent on most elements or broken on custom components; tab order broken in key flows. |
| Broken | `outline:none` with no replacement; no focus styling; or tab order clearly broken throughout. |

N/A unless a focused state is captured/probed. Note: a captured **default** browser focus ring (e.g. `outline: auto 1px`) with no custom design caps this at **Acceptable**, not Delightful.

---

## Layout

### C7 — Grid Adherence

**Measure:** Spacing/sizing snap to an 8pt (or 4pt) grid. Market Leading 100% · Delightful ≥ 95% · Acceptable 80–94% · Unpleasant 60–79% · Broken < 60%.

Look for: vertical rhythm on 16/24/32/48px (not arbitrary); left edges of headings/paragraphs/inputs/buttons line up; column widths as grid multiples; icon sizes 16/20/24 (not 17/22/23); related elements grouped closer than unrelated (Gestalt proximity); critical actions in high-attention zones (top-left, not buried in right rail); scroll affordance (partially visible element below fold); primary actions/required inputs/critical status never in the right rail.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | 100% on grid; perfect proximity groupings; scroll affordances present; critical actions in prime zones throughout. |
| Delightful | ≥ 95% on grid; proximity/groupings clear; scroll affordances present; critical actions in high-attention zones. |
| Acceptable | 80–94% aligned; minor drift (14 vs 16px gutter, heading 1px off); groupings generally clear. |
| Unpleasant | 60–79%; widespread ragged edges, inconsistent spacing in multiple sections. |
| Broken | < 60%; widespread ragged edges, or groupings ambiguous/misleading. |

N/A if resolution too low. False positives: intentional optical corrections are not violations.

### C8 — Margin & Padding

**Measure:** Margins/padding consistent AND best-practice — generous enough to breathe, not cramped.

Look for: same container padding across equivalent screens; card internal padding consistent per type and at modern scale (16–24px, not 6–8px) — first identify the product's dominant scale (compact vs generous), then flag inconsistency *with its own scale*; form field spacing ≥ 8px label-to-input, ≥ 16px between fields; safe zones around modals/toasts/popovers; whitespace reinforces hierarchy; scrollable containers have inner padding.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Perfectly consistent across all screens; whitespace masterfully creates a clear, memorable hierarchy. |
| Delightful | Consistent across screens; values follow best practice (generous but purposeful); whitespace reinforces hierarchy. |
| Acceptable | Minor drift (16 vs 20px between similar cards) OR consistent but tight/cramped throughout. |
| Unpleasant | Visibly inconsistent across screens; some cramped, some over-padded; hierarchy from whitespace unclear. |
| Broken | Visibly inconsistent (one screen cramped, another over-padded), unaligned gutters, or extreme mobile-first dispersion making desktop unreadable. |

N/A if only a single non-comparable element visible.

### C9 — IA & App Depth

**Measure:** Navigation structure is logical and domain-appropriate AND the app shows genuine product depth — multiple surfaces, complete flows, thoughtful edge cases.

Look for: multiple distinct screens with intentional nav hierarchy (not one landing page); pre-action context (onboarding/setup/guidance); post-action feedback (confirmation, updated state, next steps); purposeful detail views; progressive disclosure; nav labels naming main tasks (not "Resources"/"More"); one clear primary CTA per screen; breadcrumbs on deeper views; outcome-describing labels ("Save changes" not "Submit"); search/filter for lists > ~20 items; user can orient in < 10s.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Complete product journey — pre-action context, core workflow surfaces, post-action flows, edge cases (empty/error/stale); progressive disclosure throughout; orient within 10s on any screen. |
| Delightful | Multiple distinct surfaces with genuine depth; domain-appropriate nav groupings; key flows have pre/post-action context; some edge cases handled. |
| Acceptable | Multiple nav sections but shallow screens; core content visible but secondary flows incomplete; nav functional but generic. |
| Unpleasant | Single-surface or near-single-surface app; no flows/edge cases/context; or confusing nav labels. |
| Broken | No navigation visible / no orientation; or nav leads to empty/broken screens. |

N/A only if a single isolated widget with no nav context is captured. **Note for landing-page-only captures:** a marketing landing that leads only to a login is legitimately **shallow** — score on the depth actually observed (typically Unpleasant/Acceptable), do not assume depth that wasn't captured.

---

## Behaviours

### C10 — State Communication

**Measure:** The UI responds quickly and communicates state — loading feedback, optimistic updates, graceful error recovery, no jank.

Look for: skeleton/shimmer for async (not blank + spinner); spinners only for short (<3s) unknown-duration ops; progress bars for known duration; CTAs show loading after submit (no dead click); optimistic UI; inline errors explaining what happened and what to do next; every list/table has a designed empty state with a next-action prompt; no layout shift/FOUC; scroll position preserved on back-nav; meaningful task-completion states (a bare success screen = failure).

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Every async moment intentionally designed — skeletons, loading CTAs, inline errors with recovery, designed empty states, memorable completion states; no jank. |
| Delightful | Loading state on CTAs, graceful inline errors, designed empty states with next-action prompts, scroll preserved, meaningful completion states; no jank. |
| Acceptable | Some async states well-handled but gaps — CTAs missing loading feedback, generic empty states, or bare completion state; skeletons absent. |
| Unpleasant | Most async states absent/poorly handled; dead clicks on some CTAs; empty states missing or "No results"; error modals with no recovery. |
| Broken | Dead clicks, blank white on load, no error recovery beyond "Try again", visible layout shift, missing empty states. |

N/A only when zero loading, error, empty, and task-completion states are visible across all captures.

### C11 — Animations

**Measure:** Motion is purposeful, performant, consistent — clarifies relationships, masks latency, reinforces voice.

Look for: modals/drawers/dropdowns/tooltips ease-out at 150–250ms (not instant pop or slow fade); view transitions communicate spatial relationships; no decorative spin/pulse; routine interactions ≤ 400ms; peripheral motion must be essential; scrolljacking = Broken; `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. **Motion probe:** computed `transition`/`animation` on interactive elements and whether any stylesheet handles `prefers-reduced-motion` are strong signals when a recording isn't available.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Every transition purposeful and perfectly timed; motion consistently communicates spatial relationships; `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured; recognisable, ownable motion personality. |
| Delightful | Purposeful transitions at 150–250ms; no peripheral distractions; `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured; motion communicates spatial relationships consistently. |
| Acceptable | Some transitions but inconsistent timing/presence, OR motion decorative but not distracting. |
| Unpleasant | Inconsistent/distracting motion; some transitions > 400ms; peripheral animations interrupt tasks; no reduced-motion support. |
| Broken | Everything pops instantly (brittle) OR over-animated OR scrolljacking OR peripheral animations interrupting primary tasks. |

N/A unless motion is captured or probed. Note: transitions present with good timing (150–250ms) but **`prefers-reduced-motion` unhandled** caps this at **Acceptable**.

### C12 — Micro-interactions

**Measure:** Small crafted interaction details that make actions feel responsive and give the product personality.

Look for: button hover/active with subtle scale/color/shadow (not instant swap); toggle/switch smooth ease; checkbox/radio fill animation; validation on blur (not every keystroke); destructive actions get an undo toast; copy/save/done show confirmation; rows/list items get hover fill; designed empty states; multi-step flows show progress. Hover before/after captures and computed hover/transition signals are the primary evidence for static audits.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Rich crafted details throughout — animated toggles, blur validation with success indicators, undo toasts, designed empty states; recognisable interaction personality. |
| Delightful | Multiple crafted moments — animated toggles, blur validation, undo toasts, designed empty states, hover on all interactive elements. |
| Acceptable | Some micro-interactions present but generic — not unpleasant, nothing memorable. |
| Unpleasant | Most interactions inert; no hover states on many elements; instant state changes with no feedback. |
| Broken | Inert — no hover, instant changes with no feedback, default browser input styling, absent empty states, no validation feedback. |

N/A unless hover/active/success states are captured or probed.

---

## Content

### C13 — Content & Data Quality

**Measure:** Data/content feels real, domain-specific, built for an actual use case — not placeholder filler. AI-enhanced content the user can act on scores highest.

Signals: AI confidence scores with actionable CTAs ("87% confidence · Create work order") → Market Leading; real-looking financial data (tickers, P&L, specific dates) or domain content (equipment IDs, sensor readings, order numbers with status history) → Delightful; generic filler ("Project 2", "System Status: Operational", "User Name", placeholder KPIs) → Unpleasant; raw DB IDs (UUIDs as names) or lorem ipsum everywhere → Broken.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | AI-enhanced content surfaced at the right workflow moment — confidence % with context, predictive signals with actionable next steps, domain intelligence the user acts on; content makes the app feel genuinely intelligent. |
| Delightful | Real-looking, domain-specific data throughout — plausible names, realistic values, proper timestamps; a domain user would recognise it; no obvious placeholder patterns. |
| Acceptable | Mostly domain-relevant but some generic filler; status labels meaningful ("Shipped", "In Review") but names/values feel assembled rather than authored. |
| Unpleasant | Predominantly generic filler — sequential names, generic status strings ("OK", "Active"), placeholder KPI values with no units. |
| Broken | Raw technical identifiers exposed as content, lorem ipsum visible, critical fields empty, or content misleads about the app's function. |

N/A only if no content visible.

---

## User perception — all three carry **1.5×** weight

### C14 — Modern vs. Dated

**Measure:** Expert review, 1–5 (1 = dated, 5 = modern). Market Leading = 5 · Delightful ≥ 4 · Acceptable = 3 · Unpleasant = 2 · Broken = 1. **Include the numeric 1–5 in the evidence field.**

MODERN: soft shadows; 8–12px card radius; generous whitespace; one intentional accent; clean sans-serif ramp (Inter, SF, Geist); motion where it helps. DATED: hard drop shadows; decorative gradients; glossy buttons; default Bootstrap/jQuery UI; dense gray-on-gray text; rainbow accents; 2012-era stock icons; heavy OS scaffold with no customisation — recognisable OS chrome, unmodified default theme (stock blue `#1068eb`, `#f3f6f8` background). Glassmorphism: subtle is fine, overuse is dated. Dark-mode support is a positive signal; its absence is neutral. Benchmark: 5 = Linear, Notion, Airtable, Stripe, shadcn UIs, Vercel, Figma; 2 = OutSystems UI default theme.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading (5) | Feels like a design reference; matches/exceeds Linear, Notion, Stripe; would be cited by designers as modern UI craft. |
| Delightful (4) | Current patterns — soft shadows, proper radius, whitespace, neutral palette with intentional accent, no unnecessary gradients/skeuomorphism. |
| Acceptable (3) | Some modern elements but outdated patterns mixed in (hard drop shadows, dense gray-on-gray, decorative gradients). |
| Unpleasant (2) | Clearly dated; multiple outdated patterns (heavy borders, hard shadows, recognisable scaffold with minimal customisation). |
| Broken (1) | 2010-era — gloss, gradients, sharp corners, heavy borders, default Bootstrap, skeuomorphism. |

Always scoreable (N/A only if no product UI visible).

### C15 — WoW Effect & AI Integration

**Measure:** The app produces "I didn't expect this to be this good" — exceptional visual design, a signature interaction, or AI output surfaced usefully and surprisingly. **Include the numeric 1–5 in the evidence field.**

WOW: signature visual moment (distinctive hero, confident illustration, beautiful data viz, purposeful motion); AI output in context with a CTA ("87% match — Assign to Team A"); visible personalisation (name, last action, progress, context-aware defaults); a UI zone with a strong ownable identity; designed empty states; a distinctive, consistent animation style; delight at task completion/error resolution (earned, not forced). NOT WOW: AI hidden behind a "Generate" button with no visible output; animation that slows the task. FORGETTABLE: could be any vendor's app; templated hero; default empty states. Benchmark: 5 = Linear command bar, Stripe dashboards, Arc tabs, Superhuman shortcuts; 2 = default admin template.

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading (5) | Multiple WoW moments; AI output central to the workflow — confidence scores, predictions, recommendations visible in context, actionable, a genuine capability (not bolt-on). Or visual/interaction design cited as a reference. |
| Delightful (4) | One clear WoW moment — a signature interaction, a beautifully designed hero, or AI surfaced meaningfully; the user remembers something specific. |
| Acceptable (3) | Clean and functional with a few interesting moments but nothing standout; or AI exists but is peripheral (hidden panel, generic "Generate" with no visible output). |
| Unpleasant (2) | Purely functional, forgettable; no craft; generic KPI cards, standard tables, placeholder content. |
| Broken (1) | No WoW possibility — unfinished, template-only, or actively broken. |

N/A if only standard form/list screens captured — note that a flagship flow needs capturing.

### C16 — Visual Identity & Design Originality

**Measure:** The app has a recognisable visual voice — color, type, layout, imagery specific to this product, not confusable with another app built with the same tool.

Look for: palette authored for this product (not a default theme / generator scaffold); deliberate typography, weight usage, size ramp; distinctive, consistent layout proportions and spacing rhythm; **logo-removal test** — would a designer recognise the product from the visual alone?

| Tier | Definition |
|---|---|
| Market Leading | Completely ownable voice; identifiable from a single screen without the logo; not confusable with any other product built with the same tool. |
| Delightful | Distinct identity; original token choices; purposeful brand color, intentional type ramp, curated icons; not mistaken for another tool's output. |
| Acceptable | Some identity signals but overall look reads as a tool default or common template; could be confused with other outputs from the same generator. |
| Unpleasant | Minimal identity; visually generic; heavy reliance on template defaults; no distinctive voice. |
| Broken | No visual identity; indistinguishable from the generator's default output; no creative decisions visible. |

Always scoreable (N/A only if no product UI visible).
