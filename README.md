# OutSystems Design-System Project Template

The scaffold for a new OutSystems frontend engagement: a token → theme build pipeline, a
local preview harness, a findings/handover workflow on GitHub, and a place for the
autonomous Figma → OutSystems loop to run.

> **Starting a project? Follow [`GETTING-STARTED.md`](./GETTING-STARTED.md).**

## The split: plugin vs scaffold

Two halves, deliberately separated.

**The behaviour — the `outsystems-loop` plugin.** The 13 OutSystems skills and the `maker` /
`checker` agents are a **versioned Claude Code plugin**, not files in this repo:

```
/plugin marketplace add kharloridado/outsystems-loop
/plugin install outsystems-loop@outsystems-loop --scope project
```

Then: `/outsystems-loop:design-loop`, `@outsystems-loop:maker`, `@outsystems-loop:checker`.

Previously every project received a *copy* of the skills. Improvements earned on a real
component never flowed back, the template went stale, and the next project silently started
from an older, worse loop. As a plugin, the loop is versioned once — bump it and
`/plugin update` reaches every project.

**The scaffold — this repo.** The build pipeline, the token layers, the preview, the GitHub
issue forms and setup scripts, the loop's goal/state/refs, and the project's own values.

**The values — [`project.config.json`](./project.config.json).** One file, read by the build
scripts (via `build/lib/project-config.mjs`) and by the agents. Class prefix, JS namespace,
design-system name, ODC theme module, repo, Figma file, conventions. **Nothing else restates
them** — the last generation typed the prefix into the agents, nine build scripts and two
markdown files, and shipped a project whose two config files disagreed about it forever.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run init          # fill project.config.json + substitute every <<PLACEHOLDER>>
npm run check:config  # the drift guard; runs inside build:theme too
git submodule update --init          # then pin vendor/outsystems-ui to your ODC env's version
./.github/setup-finding-labels.sh <owner>/<repo>
./.github/setup-project.sh <owner> <owner>/<repo> "<board name>"
npm run build:theme   # → dist/theme.css, paste into the ODC Theme editor
npm run preview       # local Live Style Guide harness in a real browser
```

Then fill `design/brand-guidelines.md` + `design/figma-links.md`, set the goal and the
signed-off component inventory in `loop/goal.md`, and run `/outsystems-loop:design-loop`.

## Two rules worth knowing before you read anything else

**Fidelity first, flag don't fix.** The implementation always matches the approved design.
When the design conflicts with WCAG 2.2 AA, the brand palette, or the token system, it is
built faithfully and raised as a **finding** — never silently "corrected". Implementation-level
accessibility that does not change the visual design (focus rings in the design's own colours,
keyboard handlers, ARIA, semantics, reduced motion) is applied automatically.

**Conventions are three-state.** Every entry in `conventions` is
`{ value, status: confirmed | assumed | TBD }`, and **only `confirmed` is a rule**. The checker
may not raise findings against anything else. A template that ships a plausible-but-unverified
default (`spacing base: 4pt`) makes the loop manufacture false-positive bugs against it. A
credible-looking default is worse than a blank.

## The two GitHub outputs

**Findings → Bug issues.** A design conflict is logged in `findings/findings-register.md` and,
at the `high+` gate, opened as a Bug for the designer. Never auto-fixed.

**Handovers → Task issues.** Generated code is handed to the developer as a Task that
**contains the CSS/JS to paste into ODC** — not a repo path to go and find — plus a Mentor
Studio prompt that scaffolds the OutSystems side. Both land on one Project board; only
board-**Approved** items reach an OutSystems build.
